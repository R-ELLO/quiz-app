          ],
          answer: "Fluorine",
          factoid: "Fluorine is the most electronegative element because it has 5 electrons in its 2p shell. The optimal electron configuration of the 2p orbital contains 6 electrons, so since fluorine is so close to ideal electron configuration, the electrons are held very tightly to the nucleus."

          ],
          answer: "H2O",
          factoid: "Made up of two elements, hydrogen and oxygen and chemical formula is H2O. It means two hydrogen molecules are bonded with one oxygen molecule. Water has three states, when liquid it is called water, when gas it is called vapor and when solid it is called ice."

          ],
          answer: "All of the above are possible",
          factoid: "Approximately 60% to over 72% of the human adult body is water. Generally, an adult male needs about 3 liters (3.2 quarts) per day while an adult female needs about 2.2 liters (2.3 quarts) per day."

          ],
          answer: "Photosynthesis",
          factoid: "Organisms that use light for the energy needed to make their own food are called producers. In contrast, consumers are creatures that eat producers to get energy. While plants are the best-known producers, algae, cyanobacteria, and some protists also make sugar via photosynthesis."

A number of volcanoes form a ring around the basin which is where the name comes from. This area is home to many earthquakes due to volcanic activity and the movement of tectonic plates. The Pacific Ocean contains more than 75,000 volcanoes."
